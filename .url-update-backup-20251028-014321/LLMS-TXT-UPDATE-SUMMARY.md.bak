# llms.txt Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Updated By**: Sophia (AI Assistant)  
**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive context for LLM agents working with this repository

---

## What is llms.txt?

**llms.txt** is a standardized file format (spec: https://llmstxt.org) that provides LLM agents with:
- Project context and goals
- Priority documents to read first
- Repository structure and navigation
- Common tasks and workflows
- Security and usage guidelines

Think of it as a **"README for AI agents"** - it helps LLMs understand the project quickly and work more effectively.

### 7. Notes to LLM Tools/Agents Section (Lines 214-257)

**Comprehensive guidance for AI agents:**

#### Important Context
1. This is a REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION - users will clone/fork/copy code
2. Ansible roles are REUSABLE - can be used independently or together
3. Quarkus app is ONE EXAMPLE - not the only application type
4. EE building is INFRASTRUCTURE - not the primary focus
5. GPL v3.0 LICENSE - allows copying and modification

#### When Working With This Repository
- Focus on reusability: make roles easy to extract and use
- Document multiple application examples (not just Quarkus)
- Preserve dual-workflow architecture (development + end-user)
- Follow Diataxis documentation framework
- Respect ADR decisions (see `/docs/adr/`)
- Use `AGENTS.md` for development rules and conventions

#### Common Tasks
- Adding new roles: Follow ADR-002 architecture
- Adding new applications: Follow Quarkus example structure
- Updating documentation: Use Diataxis categories
- Making architectural decisions: Create new ADR
- Testing changes: Use Makefile targets (build, test, validate)

#### Security
- Do not request or store RHSM activation keys or Hub tokens
- Use pre-commit hooks with gitleaks (v1.0 release)
- Follow security best practices in `validated_patterns_secrets` role
- Validate RBAC and network policies

#### Build and Test Commands
```bash
make clean      # Remove build artifacts
make token      # Verify ANSIBLE_HUB_TOKEN
make build      # Build EE image
make test       # Run playbook with ansible-navigator
make lint       # Run yamllint
make publish    # Push image to registry
```

#### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Development workflow
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/deploy_complete_pattern.yml

# End-user workflow
# Use VP Operator (see END-USER-GUIDE.md)

# Testing
# See /tests/ directory for integration tests
```

## Benefits for LLM Agents

### 1. **Faster Onboarding**
- Agents understand project purpose immediately
- Clear navigation to priority documents
- Comprehensive context without reading entire codebase

### 2. **Better Decisions**
- Understand reusability focus (don't suggest monolithic changes)
- Know Quarkus is ONE example (suggest other application types)
- Respect dual-workflow architecture (don't merge workflows)

### 3. **Consistent Behavior**
- Follow ADR decisions
- Use Diataxis documentation framework
- Respect security guidelines
- Use correct build/test commands

### 4. **Reduced Errors**
- Don't suggest storing secrets
- Don't focus on EE building as primary purpose
- Don't assume Quarkus is the only application type
- Don't break dual-workflow architecture
