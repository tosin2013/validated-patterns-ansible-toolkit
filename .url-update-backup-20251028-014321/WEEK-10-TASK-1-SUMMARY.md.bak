## Technical Implementation

### Environment Configurations

**Dev Environment:**
- Namespace: `quarkus-dev`
- Replicas: 1
- Image Tag: `dev`
- Resource Profile: Development
- High Availability: No

**Prod Environment:**
- Namespace: `reference-app`
- Replicas: 3
- Image Tag: `latest`
- Resource Profile: Production
- High Availability: Yes

### Validation Points

**Common Validations:**
- Namespace creation and labels
- Deployment success
- Pod status (Running)
- Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- Health endpoints (liveness, readiness)
- Service and route configuration

**Prod-Specific Validations:**
- Multiple replicas (3)
- Pod distribution across nodes
- Load balancing verification
- Rolling update strategy
- Metrics endpoint availability

## Test Execution

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to test directory
cd tests/week10/multi-environment

# Run all tests
./run_multi_env_tests.sh
```

### Manual Execution

```bash
# Dev overlay test
ansible-playbook -i ../inventory test_dev_overlay.yml

# Prod overlay test
ansible-playbook -i ../inventory test_prod_overlay.yml
```

### Expected Output

## Key Insights

### Technical Learnings

1. **Kustomize Integration**
   - Using `oc apply -k` is more reliable than kubernetes.core.k8s module
   - Kustomize overlays provide excellent environment separation
   - Path management requires careful handling in multi-level directories

2. **Test Automation**
   - Prerequisites validation prevents common errors
   - Automated test runners improve efficiency
   - Color-coded output enhances readability
   - Test result tracking enables quick issue identification

3. **Environment Validation**
   - Dev/prod configurations require different validation strategies
   - High availability testing needs node distribution checks
   - Resource limits should be environment-specific
   - Health endpoints are critical for deployment verification

### Best Practices

1. **Test Design**
   - Idempotent tests can run multiple times safely
   - Comprehensive validation catches configuration issues
   - Automated reporting provides excellent traceability
   - Clear success criteria enable objective evaluation

2. **Documentation**
   - Quick start guides accelerate onboarding
   - Troubleshooting guides reduce support burden
   - Comprehensive READMEs improve maintainability
   - Code comments enhance understanding

3. **Automation**
   - Prerequisites checks prevent wasted time
   - Automated execution ensures consistency
   - Result tracking enables trend analysis
   - Error handling improves reliability
