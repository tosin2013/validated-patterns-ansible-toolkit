# Technology Stack

This document provides an overview of the specific technologies and dependencies used in this project to build the default Ansible Execution Environment.

## Core Technologies

- **Ansible:** The automation engine for which the execution environments are built.
- **Python:** The underlying language for Ansible and many of the required collections and modules.
- **YAML:** The language used for Ansible playbooks and configuration files.
- **RHEL 9 UBI:** The base operating system for the container image, provided by `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-minimal-rhel9:latest`.

## Build and Execution Tools

- **ansible-builder:** The primary tool for building execution environment container images, configured via `execution-environment.yml`.
- **ansible-navigator:** The recommended tool for running playbooks using the built execution environments, configured via `ansible-navigator.yml`.
- **Podman:** The default container runtime used to build and run the container images.
- **Make:** Used to orchestrate the build, test, and publish processes via the `Makefile`.

## Why these choices

- AAP base images provide certified content and security updates, reducing maintenance risk.
- Podman supports rootless containers and SELinux, aligning with hardened RHEL hosts.
- `ansible-builder` encodes dependencies as code, improving reproducibility versus adâ€‘hoc Dockerfiles.
- `make` gives simple, discoverable workflows (`make build test publish`).
