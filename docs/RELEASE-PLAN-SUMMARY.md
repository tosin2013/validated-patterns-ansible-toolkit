# Release Plan Summary - Validated Patterns Toolkit v1.0

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Planning Complete  
**Release Manager**: @tosin2013

---

## What We Created

A comprehensive **RELEASE-PLAN.md** for the Validated Patterns Toolkit v1.0 release that clarifies:

### 1. Repository Purpose (Clarified)

**This is a Reference Implementation and Reusable Toolkit** for deploying Validated Patterns on OpenShift.

**NOT**: Just an Ansible Execution Environment builder  
**IS**: A complete toolkit with reusable Ansible roles, reference applications, and deployment patterns

### 2. How People Will Use It

‚úÖ **Clone/Fork** the entire repository for their own pattern deployments  
‚úÖ **Copy Individual Ansible Roles** into their own automation projects  
‚úÖ **Use as Template** for building similar toolkits  
‚úÖ **Reference Implementation** for Quarkus apps, OpenShift AI, or custom workloads  
‚úÖ **Extend and Customize** under GPL v3.0 license

### 3. Key Clarifications Made

#### Reference Applications
- **Quarkus app is ONE example** - not the only application type
- Users can deploy:
  - OpenShift AI notebooks and pipelines
  - Python Flask/Django applications
  - Node.js applications
  - Spring Boot applications
  - Machine learning workloads
  - Any containerized application

#### Ansible Roles are the Core Value
- **7 production-ready roles** (3,460+ LOC)
- Each role can be used **independently**
- Roles are **reusable** in any Ansible project
- Clear documentation for extracting and using roles

#### Execution Environment is Infrastructure
- EE building is just the **container infrastructure** for running the roles
- Not the primary focus of the repository
- Enables running Ansible roles in containers

## Questions Answered

### Q: What is the goal of this repository?
**A**: Reference implementation and reusable toolkit for deploying Validated Patterns on OpenShift. People will clone/fork/copy the code and roles for their own projects.

### Q: Is the Quarkus app the only application type?
**A**: No! Quarkus is ONE example. Users can deploy OpenShift AI notebooks, Python apps, Node.js apps, ML pipelines, or any containerized application.

### Q: Can people copy the Ansible roles?
**A**: Yes! The roles are designed to be reusable. Users can copy individual roles into their own projects. GPL v3.0 license allows this.

### Q: What about the Execution Environment?
**A**: EE building is infrastructure for running the Ansible roles in containers. It's not the primary focus, but it's necessary infrastructure.

### Q: Will roles be published to Ansible Galaxy?
**A**: Optional for future releases. v1.0 focuses on making roles easy to copy/extract. Galaxy publication can be added based on community feedback.
