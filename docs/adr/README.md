# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Validated Patterns Template project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document important architectural decisions made during the project. They provide context, rationale, and consequences of decisions, making it easier for current and future team members to understand why certain choices were made.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Superseded, or Deprecated
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The situation and problem being addressed
- **Decision**: The chosen solution
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes

## Current ADRs

### Foundation

- [ADR-001: Project Vision and Scope](ADR-001-project-vision-and-scope.md) - **Proposed**
  - Establishes the overall vision, goals, and scope for the Validated Patterns Template
  - Defines the comprehensive architecture with Ansible, Quarkus, Tekton, and Gitea
  - Outlines implementation phases and success criteria

### Core Architecture

- [ADR-002: Ansible Role Architecture](ADR-002-ansible-role-architecture.md) - **Proposed**
  - Defines the modular Ansible role structure for idempotent deployments
  - Establishes patterns for error handling and rollback
  - Provides templates for pattern-specific configurations

- [ADR-003: Multi-Stage Validation Framework](ADR-003-validation-framework.md) - **Proposed**
  - Hybrid Ansible + Tekton validation approach
  - Pre-deployment, during-deployment, and post-deployment validation
  - Continuous validation with Tekton pipelines

### Application Components

- [ADR-004: Quarkus Reference Application](ADR-004-quarkus-reference-application.md) - **Proposed**
  - Reference implementation for user applications
  - Demonstrates cloud-native best practices
  - Shows Kubernetes/OpenShift configuration patterns
  - GitOps integration examples
  - Educational tool, NOT a management application

- [ADR-005: Gitea Development Environment](ADR-005-gitea-development-environment.md) - **Proposed**
  - Self-hosted Git environment on OpenShift
  - Integration with pattern deployment workflows
  - Support for air-gapped and training scenarios

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ADR-006: Execution Context Handling](ADR-006-execution-context-handling.md) - **Proposed**
  - Support for both root directory and subdirectory execution
  - Environment variable-based context detection
  - Path resolution utilities for all components

### User Experience

- [ADR-007: Ansible Navigator Deployment Strategy](ADR-007-ansible-navigator-deployment.md) - **Proposed**
  - Simplified deployment workflow for end users
  - Containerized execution with Podman
  - Single-command pattern deployment
  - CI/CD integration patterns

### Repository Management

- [ADR-008: Repository Rename](ADR-008-repository-rename.md) - **Proposed**
  - Rename from validated-patterns-ansible-toolkit to validated-patterns-toolkit
  - Better reflects comprehensive scope
  - Migration guide for existing users
  - Communication plan

### Platform-Specific Validation

- [ADR-009: OpenShift AI Workload Validation](ADR-009-openshift-ai-validation.md) - **Proposed**
  - Validation for OpenShift AI (RHOAI) deployments
  - Operator, notebooks, pipelines, and model serving validation
  - No sample application - infrastructure validation only
  - GPU/accelerator validation support
  - Integrated with Ansible and Tekton

## Creating a New ADR

1. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp ADR-TEMPLATE.md ADR-XXX-your-title.md
   ```

2. **Fill in the details**:
   - Use the next available number (XXX)
   - Write a clear, descriptive title
   - Complete all sections

3. **Submit for review**:
   - Create a pull request
   - Tag relevant team members
   - Link to related issues or ADRs

4. **Update the index**:
   - Add your ADR to this README
   - Update the status as it progresses

## ADR Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet decided
- **Accepted**: Decision made, ready for implementation
- **Rejected**: Considered but not chosen
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant or applicable

## ADR Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- **Architecture**: System structure, component interactions
- **Technology**: Framework, library, or tool selection
- **Patterns**: Design patterns, coding standards
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, scaling, monitoring
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, secrets management
- **Integration**: External systems, APIs, protocols

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create an ADR for:

- **Implementation details**: Specific variable names, file locations
- **Temporary decisions**: Workarounds, quick fixes
- **Obvious choices**: Industry-standard practices
- **Personal preferences**: Code formatting (use linters instead)

### Writing Good ADRs

**Do:**
- ✅ Be concise but complete
- ✅ Explain the context and problem clearly
- ✅ List alternatives considered
- ✅ Document trade-offs and consequences
- ✅ Include references and links
- ✅ Use diagrams when helpful

**Don't:**
- ❌ Write a novel (keep it focused)
- ❌ Skip the "why" (context is crucial)
- ❌ Ignore alternatives (show you considered options)
- ❌ Hide negative consequences (be honest)
- ❌ Use jargon without explanation
